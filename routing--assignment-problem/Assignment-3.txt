1) Add routes to load "Courses" and "Users" on different pages 
    (by rendering a URL without Links).
2) Add a simple navigation with two links => One loading "Users", 
    one loading "Courses".
3) Makes the courses in "Courses" clickable by adding a link and 
    load the "Course" component n the place of "Courses" (without 
    passing any data for now).
4) Pass the course ID to the "Course" page and output it there
5) Pass the course title to the "Course" page - pass it as a param 
    or score bonus points by passing it as query params (you need 
    to manually parse them though!)
6) Load the "Course" component as a nested component of "Courses"
7) Add a 404 error page and render it for any unknown routes
8) Redirect requests to /all-courses to /courses (=> Your "Courses" page)
